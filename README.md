Dear MahMohammad Reza,

We are delighted to have you in this stage of our evaluation pool. In order to fully demonstrate your exceptional abilities, it is recommended that you utilize the most current solutions. Our goal is to outline our anticipated project, which serves as the primary task for evaluation.
Initially, a visualized concept is available on a Figma file that can be accessed locally via your personal Figma account. Additionally, a GraphQL server has been provided to enable access to the database for authentication and authorization purposes.
Our expectation for the project includes a login section that is immediately visible and provides users with the capability to authorize within the project. Upon successful authorization, users should have the ability to access a list of all associated subset users via the getUser API. Furthermore, each user possesses specific roles and it is necessary to provide a straightforward platform for modifying and submitting role changes.

Given the constraint that only one role assignment or removal is permitted for a user in each GraphQL fetch request, it is imperative to address the platform's functionality to ensure that any modifications made to a user's role are accurately recorded and processed before submission.

Some features that should be considered include:
1.	A dark/light theme
2.	Multi-language support (English is default with the ability to switch to Farsi)
3.	Mandatory development with TypeScript
4.	Development with React and Next.js (preferred)
5.	Use of a UI kit such as MUI or CSS framework like Tailwind
6.	Writing Unit, Integration, and E2E tests (preferred)
7.	Use of front cache (preferred)
8.	Thorough documentation of all developed features
Please note that the Figma file serves only as a visualized concept and should not be considered as an exact blueprint for coding. You are encouraged to utilize your own creative viewpoint. The project must be completed and submitted within a maximum of three days.
